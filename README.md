# slambook
This is the code written for my new book about visual SLAM called "14 lectures on visual SLAM" which was released in April 2017. It is highy recommended to download the code and run it in you own machine so that you can learn more efficiently and also modify it. The code is stored by chapters like "ch2" and "ch4". Note that chapter 9 is a project so I stored it in the "project" directory.

If you have any questions about the code, please add an issue so I can see it. Contact me for more information: gao dot xiang dot thu at gmail dot com.

These codes are under MIT license. You don't need permission to use it or change it. 
Please cite this book if you are doing academic work:
